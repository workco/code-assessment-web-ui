# 1. Implement Product Details Page - Level III

Implement the Product modal as shown in the Figma design file: https://www.figma.com/file/TghrEZgi3nl3t3iZ72Ufmt/Code-Assessment---Final.

Requirements:

- Users should be able to open the product modal from both the homepage and Cart modal, or navigate to a route in the format `/product/:productId`
- Closing the Product modal should take the user to the homepage, no matter where they came from
- No animation is required when switching between active images in the PDP image picker
- Don't worry about wiring up quantity/add to bag buttons
- Our data contains some placeholder.com images for certain image types - this is expected
- No specific loading/404 behavior is required, as long as these events do not lead to an error

# 2. Implement a State Management Library - Level III

Replace our use of React Context with the state management library of your choice (Apollo, Redux, MobX, urql, etc). While youâ€™re at it, please wire up two API integrations. You may choose between GraphQL or REST.

1. Fetch products on app load via `products` GraphQL resolver or `/products` endpoint
2. Calculate cart totals via `cart` GraphQL resolver or `/cart` endpoint

See https://github.com/workco/code-assessment-api for more API documentation.

Requirements:

- Shipping should display "FREE" when the total shipping cost is $0.
